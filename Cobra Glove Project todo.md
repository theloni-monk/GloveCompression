### Viz
- [x] check that X maps to twisting, Y maps to ab/adduciton ✅ 2026-01-20
^ correct, y is palm-plane rotation, x is kuckle-plain rotation
- Trial-avg version + sem to sanity check that initial starting position
    - check if this makes sense?
- [ ] export a few task 
- [ ] side-by-side PCA viz:  
- Number of PCs per task (for 1 participant), how generalizable are PCs across task?
- Visualization for comparing undersensorized data (e.g. PC hands) to full data hand

### Explore
Implementing constraints from biomechanics:  
- 1) limits on jt angles/ combinations
    - rough guesses based on own hand
- 2) dynamics learned from data (e.g. could be participant-specific)

### Comm
- [ ] Reach out to Jorge about CIVO access to Meta Wristband devkit
