### Viz
- [ ] check that X maps to twisting, Y maps to ab/adduciton
- Trial-avg version + sem to sanity check that initial starting position
    - check if this makes sense?
side-by-side PCA viz:  
- Number of PCs per task (for 1 participant), how generalizable are PCs across task?
- Visualization for comparing undersensorized data (e.g. PC hands) to full data hand

### Explore
Implementing constraints from biomechanics:  
- 1) limits on jt angles/ combinations
    - rough guesses based on own hand
- 2) dynamics learned from data (e.g. could be participant-specific)

### Comm
- [ ] Reach out to Jorge about CIVO access to Meta Wristband devkit
