population coding is predominant anaysis technique

rate coding analysis of many neurons -> do dPCA
dPCA is like PCA, but has distinct encoding and decoding matrices, rather than adjoint encoding and decoding

visually guided movements have three distinct dynamic motifs

- preparatory dimensions (kaufman 2014)

- motor trigger (Condition-Invariant Signal)
	- Roughly 150ms before movement onset (kaufman 2016)
	- condition invariant pca-type analysis captures over 50% variance in that window
	- studied only in visual cue tasks
	- _question_: does this visual cue behavior generalize to general somatosensory feedback
	- motor-thalamus timing control
		- M1 gets dense projections from S1 and Cerebelum-motor thalamus
		- M1 trigger signal seems to be delayed if you degrade motor thalamus response
		- reaction-time impact
